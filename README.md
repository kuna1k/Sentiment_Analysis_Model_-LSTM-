This repository contains the code and resources for a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The model demonstrates high performance with a training accuracy of 92.54% and a validation accuracy of 85.61%. Used existing outline revamping model for increased efficiency and generalization to other text elements (product reviews).

The implementation involves preprocessing data with tokenization and padding to handle sequences effectively. The LSTM model architecture includes embedding layers and LSTM layers, enhanced with dropout techniques to manage sequential dependencies in text data and prevent overfitting. Extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to balance model complexity and performance, establishing an optimal configuration for accurate sentiment predictions.

This model can be adapted for various review types and domains, making it a versatile tool for sentiment analysis tasks beyond movie reviews.
